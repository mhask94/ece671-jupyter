    "##  Introduction\n",
    "Eigen values and eigen vectors are very cool and show up all over the place. The basic idea is that matrix multiplication is turned into scalar multiplication. This seems strange since matrix multiplication is complex and you can't always envision the result by just looking at the equation. Matrices can be used to project onto a lower dimensional space and rotate a vector, which is how they are commonly used. However, when multiplying a matrix by one of its eigenvectors, that vector will just be scaled by the value of the corresponding eigenvalue. The eigenvector can grow, shrink, and flip directions (i.e. eigenvalues can be negative). Eigenvalues can even be zero, in which case the eigenvector multiplied by the matrix will be scaled down to zero as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "The physical meaning of eigenvalues and eigenvectors is also cool. The eigenvectors are the principal axes of the matrix. This means that the eigenvectors of a stress/strain tensor are the principal axes and the eigenvalues are the principal stresses/strains. Another example is with an inertia tensor. If there are cross terms (elements off the main diagonal in the inertia tensor) the eigenvectors are the axes of the object that get rid of the cross terms. This means you can find the x, y, and z axes where there is symmetry and no inertia in any other direction."
